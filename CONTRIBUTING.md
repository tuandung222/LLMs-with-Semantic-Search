# Contributing to Semantic Search

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Semantic Search as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Read our [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md)
4. Make your changes
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: add amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

## 📝 Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows our coding standards.
6. Issue that pull request!

## 📋 Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with a note describing your changes.
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer.

## 🐛 Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker]

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/semantic-search/issues/new).

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## 📖 Documentation

- Keep documentation up to date
- Use clear and consistent terminology
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Document both success and error scenarios

## 🔍 Code Review Process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis.
After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the PR if it isn't showing any activity.

## 🎨 Coding Style

- We use Black for Python code formatting
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Write meaningful commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Include type hints
- Add docstrings to functions and classes

## 🔒 Security

- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Report security vulnerabilities privately
- Follow secure coding practices
- Keep dependencies updated
